To ensure Docker Desktop stores all its data (images, containers, volumes, etc.) in D drive, you need to reconfigure Docker after installation. Here’s a step-by-step guide to move Docker storage to the D drive:


---

Step 1: Stop Docker Desktop

Before making any changes:

1. Right-click the Docker Desktop icon in the system tray.


2. Click Quit Docker Desktop to stop Docker.




---

Step 2: Modify Docker’s Storage Location

Option A: Modify daemon.json Configuration

1. Navigate to the Docker configuration directory:

Open the path C:\ProgramData\Docker\config.

If the config folder or daemon.json file does not exist, create them manually.



2. Open (or create) the file daemon.json in a text editor like Notepad.


3. Add or update the following configuration to specify the data-root directory on the D drive:

{
  "data-root": "D:\\docker-data"
}

Replace D:\\docker-data with your desired path on the D drive.


4. Save the file and close the editor.

Step 3: Move Existing Docker Data (Optional)

If Docker has already downloaded data to the C drive, you can move it to the D drive:

1. Navigate to the existing Docker data directory:

Typically located at C:\ProgramData\Docker.



2. Copy or move the Docker directory to your desired location on the D drive (e.g., D:\docker-data).


3. Ensure the path you’ve set in daemon.json matches the directory where you’ve moved the data.




---

Step 4: Restart Docker

1. Open Docker Desktop again.


2. Docker will now use the D drive for all its data storage as specified in the daemon.json file.




---

Step 5: Verify Configuration

1. Open Docker Desktop.


2. Pull a new image or start a container to confirm the data is being stored in the new location (e.g., D:\docker-data).


3. Check the size of the folder on the D drive to verify that it’s being used.

Alternative: Uninstall and Reinstall Docker with a New Data Directory

If the above steps feel complicated, you can:

1. Uninstall Docker Desktop completely.


2. Delete all residual data from C:\ProgramData\Docker.


3. Reinstall Docker Desktop and immediately modify the daemon.json file before pulling or running any containers.
