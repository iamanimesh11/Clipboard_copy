Dear All,

Apologies for any inconvenience caused.

The RPA output for today has been shared. Please note that todayâ€™s output was generated using the file Unprocessed Invoice Checking_12092025.xlsx. The worksheet in HQ_RPA_Un_Booked Expense Tracking System_10092025.xlsx is also available on the FTP server.

In case of any miscalculations, kindly ensure that the last pendency file is updated, along with the AP movement file, as the two-day RPA failure may have created a gap.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Animesh
