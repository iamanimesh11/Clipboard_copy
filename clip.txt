S3 Standard

S3 Intelligent-Tiering

S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

S3 One Zone-IA

S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive

Lifecycle policies (transition, expiration)

Intelligent-tiering automation


4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Management

Multipart upload (for large files)

Upload concurrency

Object locking / WORM (Write Once Read Many)

S3 Inventory (reporting on objects)

S3 Batch Operations


5Ô∏è‚É£ Access & Security

IAM policies vs Bucket policies

S3 endpoints (VPC endpoints, Gateway endpoints)

Cross-region replication (CRR)

Cross-account access

Pre-signed URLs (temporary access)


7Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Features

Event notifications (Lambda, SQS, SNS triggers)

S3 Select (querying CSV/JSON/Parquet files)

S3 Object Lambda

Glacier retrieval types (Expedited, Standard, Bulk)

Requester pays buckets


8Ô∏è‚É£ Integration with AWS Services

AWS Glue (Data catalog)

Athena (query S3 data directly)

Redshift Spectrum

Lambda triggers

CloudWatch & EventBridge integration

Data pipelines & Airflow / Step Functions

SageMaker (ML datasets from S3)


9Ô∏è‚É£ Performance & Optimization

Multipart upload & download

Transfer Acceleration

Data compression strategies

Caching (CloudFront with S3)

Monitoring with CloudWatch metrics

Cost optimization using Storage Class Analysis


üîü Best Practices

Bucket naming and structure for data lakes

Data lifecycle and cost efficiency

Security & compliance

Disaster recovery & replication strategies

Monitoring and auditing access

üí° Pro Tip: For exams or real-world mastery, don‚Äôt just memorize ‚Äî try to do small hands-on tasks for each topic. That‚Äôs how commands and concepts stick for 10+ years.

If you want, I can now make a ‚ÄúReady-to-Use S3 Mastery Checklist‚Äù where you tick off each topic with CLI + Boto3 mini-exercises.
It‚Äôll take you from beginner ‚Üí advanced in a structured way and ensure you never forget S3.

Do you want me to make that next?
