Here’s an improved version with a **minimal, clean starting point** that sets context (“Parquet is columnar, right?”) and then reveals the *dynamic encoding* twist.

## 🚀 We All Say “Parquet is Columnar”… But What If It’s *More* Than That?

Most people stop at:

> “Parquet is a columnar storage format.”

True — but that’s just the surface.
Underneath, Parquet behaves more like a **self-optimizing data engine** than a storage file.

Here’s the part almost nobody talks about 👇

### 🔥 Parquet uses *dynamic encoding* — and it can change encoding **page by page** inside the same column.

To see why this is wild, look at how raw data is normally stored:

```
India  
India  
India  (10,000 times)
```

Or:

```
100, 101, 102, 103…
```

Or:

```
A, A, A, A, B, B, C
```

Traditional storage just writes values as-is.
Parquet looks at them and *rewrites* them using intelligent encodings:

* **Dictionary:** store "India" once → represent all rows as integers
* **Delta:** store 100 → then +1, +1, +1…
* **RLE:** store “A × 4, B × 2, C × 1”

But here’s the mind-bender:

### ⭐ Parquet doesn’t pick one encoding per column.

It **adapts** encoding *mid-file* depending on the data distribution.

If the first million rows compress well with dictionary encoding → great.
If the next million suddenly have high-cardinality values → Parquet switches to a different encoding automatically.
No config. No manual tuning.

It chooses the most efficient strategy for *each page*.

# ⚡ Why this matters more than “columnar storage”

Dynamic encoding gives you:

* Better compression
* Faster queries
* Lower compute bills
* Metadata that exposes data drift/cardinality issues
* A file format that optimizes itself as data changes

Parquet isn’t just “columnar.”
It’s **adaptive**.

A shape-shifting format that reacts to your data in real time — quietly improving performance without you ever asking.

And most teams never notice it.

If you want, I can also prepare:
• A more emotional storyteller version
• A version with diagrams (carousel-style)
• A version with deeper technical internals

Which one next?
