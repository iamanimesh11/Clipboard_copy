Dear FTV HELPDESK,



I'm Animesh from RPA Team and I'm writing this mail concern regarding issue in FTV login at https://ftv.lge.com/logon_lge.jsp.

We  as part of IT team develop RPA process which is basically automation bot which automate the User activity like login into ftv page and proceed to further actions.



we understand for security reason login attempts are limited on all User ID but on one specific id- X2011039 ,we need no restriction for login should be there if somehow multiple login failed .as bot has to handle which is programmed bot.



Hope you understand this and support on above mentioned id 



please inf attached file showing error on login for your referecen



thanks & Regards,

Animeshï»¿
