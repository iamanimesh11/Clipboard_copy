Dear Sunit Sir,



I hope you are doing well.

I'd like to inform you that RPA Process for all products is scheduled to run tomorrow and in RPA output there won't be any new changes (tabular and charts) as I haven't 

received any confirmation regarding Changes in DFZ product 



Thanks, and regards,

Animesh
