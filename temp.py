🚀 AWS Glue Data Catalog — Complete Topic List (Mastery + Exam Ready)


---

🟦 1. Introduction & Core Concepts

✔️ What is AWS Glue Data Catalog?

Central metadata repository for data in S3, Redshift, RDS, DynamoDB, and JDBC sources.

Stores schema definitions, table partitions, and descriptions of datasets.


✔️ Why Data Engineers use it?

Glue ETL jobs need schema info

Athena queries require catalog tables

Redshift Spectrum reads S3 through Glue tables

Lake Formation uses it for data permissions


✔️ Key components:

Database → logical grouping of tables

Tables → schema for data stored in S3 or other sources

Partitions → folder-level data grouping for performance

Schema → column names, types, formats

Classifiers → rules for schema inference by crawlers



---

🟩 2. Glue Catalog Databases

Topics:

Creating a database

Database location URI (e.g., s3://bucket/path/)

Default database

Cross-account catalog access

Permissions via IAM & Lake Formation


Exam Focus:

Catalog databases are just metadata — no actual data stored.



---

🟨 3. Glue Tables (Super Important)

They store:

Column names + types

SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer)

File format (Parquet, CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro)

Storage location (S3 prefix)

Input/Output formats


Deep-dive topics:

Table creation methods:

Via crawler

Manually

Via Athena CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE

Via Glue ETL job spark write


Table partitioning:

Folder-based partitions

Dynamic vs Static partitions

Performance improvement



Exam Focus:

How Glue infers partitions

Partition projection (Athena concept but depends on catalog)

External tables vs managed tables



---

🟧 4. Crawlers (Schema Discovery Engine)

Glue crawlers scan your data & auto-build tables.

What you MUST know:

Crawler data sources

S3

JDBC

DynamoDB


Crawler classifiers:

JSON

CSV

Grok

Custom classifiers


How schema inference works

How partitions are detected from folder paths

Crawler schedule

Crawler output behavior

Crawler versioning (schema update behavior)


Crawler conflicts & schema evolution:

What happens when new columns appear?

Crawler can update table or create new table


Exam Focus:

When NOT to use crawlers
→ Example: Structured datasets with predefined schema

How crawlers determine partition keys

How catalog updates are handled



---

🟥 5. Partitions (Critical for Performance)

Topics:

What is a partition in Glue Catalog?

Folder structure example:

s3://bucket/events/year=2025/month=11/day=20/

Static & dynamic partitioning

Partition pruning in Athena & Redshift Spectrum

Partition indexes

Partition projection (Athena)


Exam Focus:

Correct partition design reduces cost

Wrong design = scanning full dataset



---

🟪 6. Table Formats & SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer)

MUST know formats:

CSV

JSON

Parquet (most common in DE)

ORC

Avro


For each:

Advantages

Compression support

How schema is stored


SerDe examples:

OpenCSVSerde

LazySimpleSerDe

JsonSerDe


Exam Focus:

Parquet + Snappy → best performance

CSV → slowest + highest scan cost



---

🟫 7. Glue Catalog Permissions & Security

AWS IAM:

glue:* actions needed for ETL jobs

read/write from S3 based on IAM role


Lake Formation (Critical for Exam):

Table-level permissions

Column-level permissions

Database permissions

Data filtering


Encryption:

Catalog encryption (KMS)

S3 encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)


Exam Focus:

Lake Formation overrides IAM for catalog access

Cross-account access through resource shares



---

🟦 8. Glue Data Catalog vs Hive Metastore

AWS Glue Catalog is:

Hive-compatible

Serverless

Highly scalable

Used by multiple services


Know comparisons:

EMR + Hive vs Glue Catalog

When to use external Hive metastore


Exam Focus:

Glue Catalog is serverless & global within a region



---

🟩 9. Integration with AWS Services

1️⃣ Athena

Always needs Glue Catalog

CTAS creates catalog tables

Partition pruning depends on catalog partitions


2️⃣ Redshift Spectrum

Reads external tables from S3 using Glue Catalog

Uses Parquet for best performance


3️⃣ Glue ETL Jobs

Spark jobs read/write using catalog metadata


4️⃣ Lake Formation

Uses Glue Catalog to apply data access governance


5️⃣ EMR

EMR Spark can use the Glue Catalog instead of Hive metastore


Exam Focus:

Know exactly when Glue Catalog is required

Know when Athena/Redshift can create catalog tables



---

🟨 10. Catalog Maintenance & Best Practices

Topics:

Orphaned partitions cleanup

Schema evolution handling

Naming conventions

Avoid small files problem

Use compression (snappy)


Exam Focus:

Schema mismatch issues with Athena

How to fix missing partitions



---

🟥 11. Real-World Data Lake Layout

You should be able to design:

s3://my-datalake/
    raw/
        source=api/date=2025-11-20/
    processed/
        format=parquet/date=2025-11-20/
    analytics/
        model=sales/year=2025/month=11/

And create Glue Catalog tables that map to each zone.


---

🟪 12. DEA-C01 Exam-Specific Topics

AWS LOVES asking:

When to use Glue crawlers vs manual tables

How partitions are detected

Which service uses Glue Catalog

Glue Catalog + Lake Formation permission disputes

Athena query failures due to catalog mismatch

Cost optimization using partitioning + Parquet

When schema inference is wrong and how to fix
