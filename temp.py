Subject: Request to Remove Login Restriction for ID X2011039

Dear FTV Helpdesk,

I’m Animesh from the RPA Team, and I’m writing regarding an issue with the FTV login page at https://ftv.lge.com/logon_lge.jsp.

As part of the IT team, we have developed an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) bot that automates certain user activities, including logging into the FTV portal and performing subsequent actions.

We understand that, for security reasons, login attempts are limited for all user IDs. However, for one specific ID — X2011039 — we request that the login restriction be removed or relaxed. This ID is used exclusively by the automation bot, which may occasionally trigger multiple login attempts due to system handling.

Kindly review this request and support us by allowing unrestricted login access for the mentioned ID. Please find the attached file showing the login error for your reference.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Animesh
RPA Team
