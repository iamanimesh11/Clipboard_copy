I see what you’re aiming for, Animesh — you want to keep the tone professional, but your draft has some grammatical and structural issues that make it harder to read. I’ve polished it while keeping your original meaning and intent intact. Here’s a clearer version:

Subject: Project Status Update

Dear Young A Kim,

I hope this message finds you well.

Thank you for your email regarding the project status.

Last year, before moving to Cloud PC, we worked on NQVM. However, it was very slow and problematic, which is why we requested to shift to Cloud PC. In short, I prefer to use Cloud PC for any project development moving forward.

Now, regarding Windows Legacy Mode: we are facing library mismatches and dependency issues. If these cannot be resolved, we may have to rebuild the project from scratch in Windows mode, using the package versions you mentioned on the RPA portal.

Currently, we have another project called “Daily-Stock-Report” in the testing phase on your side. This project is built on Windows, and if it is successfully published to Orchestrator without errors, then we will proceed with developing the “Shipment Tracking Project” from scratch, using the same package versions as the “Daily-Stock-Report.”

As I already raised, there are concerns about slowness and system crashes in Windows mode. Because of this, I cannot provide a fixed completion timeline at the moment. Even small changes sometimes cause UiPath to crash, which makes development difficult. That said, we will manage, though it will come at the cost of extra time.

I hope you understand, and thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Animesh

Would you like me to make it more formal and concise (e.g., suitable for a manager/stakeholder), or keep it slightly casual but professional (like for a teammate/colleague)?
