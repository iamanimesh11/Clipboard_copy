There is a tournament organized between football clubs from different major cities in India. You need to create a fixtures sheet with columns Opponent_A and Opponent_B with the cities competing against each other. All the cities have to play exactly one game with the rest of the cities participating in the tournament.

Write a query to give the fixtures list in the Alphabetical Order of Opponent_A and Opponent_B.
