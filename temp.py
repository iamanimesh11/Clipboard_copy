Subject: RPA Process Update

Dear Sunit Sir,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to inform you that the RPA process for all products is scheduled to run tomorrow. Please note that there will be no new changes reflected in the RPA output (both tabular and charts), as I have not yet received any confirmation regarding changes to the DFZ product.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Best regards,
Animesh

Would you like me to make it slightly more formal and business-like (e.g., “Kindly note” instead of “Please note”), or keep it simple and conversational as above?
