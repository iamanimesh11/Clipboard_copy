Subject: Inquiry Regarding Scheduled Date for the Role

Respected Ma'am,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to kindly inquire if any date has been scheduled for the mentioned role. I sincerely hope it does not get canceled or postponed further, as I am very eager for this opportunityâ€”especially with me completing 1.5 years in my current RPA role by the end of this month.

I truly hope things work out, and I would be highly grateful for your guidance and support.

Thank you very much for your understanding.

Sincere Regards,
Animesh

Would you like me to make it slightly more formal and concise (sounding very professional), or keep it slightly warm and personal (to show eagerness)?
