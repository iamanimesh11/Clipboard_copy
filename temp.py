Respected Ma’am,

Currently, no root cause has been identified for the issue.

The Self-RPA-HELPDESK team informed me that the UiPath Windows version is still under upgrade. At present, they don’t have a solution for the unexpected crashes occurring while developing processes in the Windows environment. Additionally, there is no known way to debug the differences between the bot-PC and cloud-PC environments.

Meanwhile, the unexpected system exception continues to occur intermittently. Preetam Sir suggested that I try reinstalling UiPath once to see if it resolves the issue, so I will check this.

Best regards,
Animesh
