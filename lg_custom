we need to divide our aproach in two ways:
1. Data being geneerrated by iot sensors stores in DB and ml model further and make real time actions-insights from it/
2. Triggering alert to service team or customer app could be next

Stage 1 : Data collection:

Simply IOT senors like accelerometers, temperature sensors  produce continously regarding so It will be in time-series manner.sensors continously monitor key parameters
for ska eof simplicty lets assume data being on cloud in format of Json:
for example : 

log generation :The appliance's microcontroller or IoT module formats sensor readings into structured logs.
{
  "device_id": "WM12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-19T15:00:00Z",
  "sensor": "Load Sensor",
  "value": 15.2,
  "threshold": 12.0,
  "status": "Warning",
  "message": "Overloaded drum detected"
}

Logs are transmitted to the cloud using IOT communication portal:

MQTT: Lightweight and efficient for real-time updates.
HTTP/HTTPS: For periodic data uploads.


now where this all data willl be dumped??

if the data is completely raw and unstrucutred then we have to store all into data lake house . we can distribute this by regions or areas 
(aws s3 is ppopular storage bucket as well as snowflake for complext analytics )
for example sotring 1TB data cost about $23/month whule storing 1 tb in a data warehouse like redshift is sth about $250-$300/month
as wwarehouses chargws for computing as well. so far in short all them game is of saving cost.

now we have to think carefully about system for IOT as tradiitional methodolgy will fail and prone to critical issue with terabyes of data.
Best approach to go for Cloud platofrm as its highly scalable and manageable.


chosing perfect data warehouse is important .
time-series databases are perfect for analyzing trends ocer time.like: InfluxDB

TimescaleDB Cloud	SQL-based time-series
Amazon Timestream	AWS ecosystem
