ðŸ“‚ Table: user_events
event_id	user_id	event_type	event_time	product_id	price

1	U1	browse	2024-06-01 10:00:00	P1	NULL
2	U1	add_to_cart	2024-06-01 10:02:00	P1	500
3	U1	payment	2024-06-01 10:10:00	P1	500
4	U2	browse	2024-06-01 10:01:00	P2	NULL
5	U2	add_to_cart	2024-06-01 10:05:00	P2	800
6	U3	add_to_cart	2024-06-01 11:00:00	P3	1200
7	U4	add_to_cart	2024-06-01 11:02:00	P1	500
8	U4	payment	2024-06-01 11:10:00	P1	500

ðŸŽ¯ Expected Output:
lost_revenue :2000
(because:U2 added P2 (800) but didnâ€™t pay U3 added P3 (1200) but didnâ€™t pay )

ðŸ§  Hint (if needed later):
You can use a LEFT JOIN or NOT EXISTS to check if the payment exists for same user_id + product_id.
