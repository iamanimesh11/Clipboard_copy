### 🚀 Project Launch: Real-Time IoT ETL for Reactive and Predictive Maintenance 🔧📊



Sharing my latest project — a **fully containerized, real-time IoT ETL system** for **smart maintenance workflows** 🚨🤖



📌 **Architecture diagram** attached below for a complete technical overview 👇

### 🌐 What’s This About?



🔧 **Reactive Maintenance** (✅ Implemented):



Simulated the entire ecosystem from device to client with:

🛰️ IoT Devices publishing real-time error events via MQTT, simulating a real-world connected infrastructure

🧠 Backend Services (FastAPI + Flask) to:

Register devices and issue auth tokens

Validate incoming events and route them for processing

🔄 Apache Kafka pipelines for event stream processing and decoupling components

🗃️ PostgreSQL (Modular Schema Design) to store:

- Device metadata

- Customer information

- Auth tokens

- Subscriptions

- Services

- Logged error events

🛎️ Error alerts sent instantly to the registered service CRM system (simulated via internal API call) for service team action

📈 Grafana Loki used to aggregate logs from all services and micro-backends

👁️‍🗨️ Grafana Dashboards show real-time logs, events, and service health for observability

🐳 Fully containerized setup to simulate a production-like environment

🔔 Discord integration for incident alerting to dev/ops teams



🔮 **Predictive Maintenance** (🚧 Coming Soon):



* **Anomaly detection** from historical logs

* Machine Learning to send **proactive alerts before breakdowns**
