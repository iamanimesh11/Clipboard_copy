🚀 Project Launch: Real-Time IoT ETL for Reactive and Predictive Maintenance 🔧📊

Excited to share my latest project — a fully containerized, end-to-end system for real-time error monitoring and smart maintenance workflows!

📌 Architecture diagram attached below for a complete technical overview 👇

---

🔧 Reactive Maintenance (✅ Completed):

IoT devices send real-time errors via MQTT

Alerts automatically pushed to CRM on failure

All service logs centralized in Grafana Loki

Visualized in Grafana dashboards for real-time insight

Logging & subscription info stored in modular PostgreSQL schemas


🔮 Predictive Maintenance (🚧 In Progress):

Anomaly detection pipeline based on historical device logs

Proactive alerts before issues occur using machine learning


---

🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights

📡 Data Source: Mock IoT data generated via Python scripts

⏰ Scheduler: Apache Airflow for orchestrating ETL jobs

🔄 Streaming: Apache Kafka for real-time data pipelines

💾 Storage: PostgreSQL for structured data storage

📊 Monitoring & Logging: Grafana Loki dashboards with alerts

🧠 In-Memory Storage: Redis for caching and pub-sub

📲 IoT Communication Protocol: MQTT for lightweight messaging

⚙️ Backend APIs: FastAPI & Flask for device registration and event intake

💻 User Interface: Streamlit dashboard to display device status

🐳 Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose for deployment

📢 Alerts & Notifications: Discord integration for real-time error reporting

🐍 Language: Python — the brain behind the system 🧠🐍
