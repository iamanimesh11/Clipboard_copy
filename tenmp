Hereâ€™s a tailored Data Engineer-focused version of your project for the resume, with measurable impact and strong tech emphasis:


---

Real-Time Traffic & Weather Data Pipeline (Personal Project)
Tools: Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, Docker, Grafana Loki, Discord Webhooks

Built an end-to-end real-time data engineering pipeline that collects and processes 250+ live API responses daily from Overpass, TomTom Traffic, and WeatherAPI.

Designed a decoupled ingestion architecture using Apache Kafka, enabling scalable, asynchronous data streaming into PostgreSQL.

Orchestrated ETL workflows using Apache Airflow, ensuring timely scheduling and fault-tolerant task execution.

Achieved ~80% improvement in reliability and observability through centralized logging using Grafana Loki and Discord alerting for system monitoring.

Implemented optimized database schema and bulk insert strategies for efficient storage and high-performance querying.

Utilized Docker Compose to containerize all services with persistent storage and simplified deployment.

Applied best practices like externalized configuration (config.yaml) and secure credential handling for scalable development.

Demonstrated strong data engineering principles across ingestion, transformation, scheduling, logging, and monitoring.
