Perfect! We can make this super interactive for LinkedIn by breaking the SQL + output into a step-by-step “mini business case” that your readers can follow, almost like a hands-on exercise.

Here’s how we can structure it:

LinkedIn Post: Step-by-Step Cohort Analysis Challenge

🛒 Scenario:

You are a data analyst at an e-commerce company.
The marketing team wants to track user retention by signup month.

They ask:
1️⃣ How many users return after signup?
2️⃣ For each signup month cohort, what percentage of users are active in month 0, month 1, month 2…?

Goal: Help marketing plan campaigns and improve retention.

Step 1: Assign Users to Cohorts

SQL:

WITH user_cohort AS (
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        signup_date,
        DATE_FORMAT(signup_date, '%Y-%m') AS cohort_month
    FROM users
)
SELECT * FROM user_cohort LIMIT 5;

Example Output:

user_id	signup_date	cohort_month

1	2024-01-15	2024-01
2	2024-01-18	2024-01
3	2024-02-02	2024-02
4	2024-02-25	2024-02
5	2024-03-10	2024-03


> ✅ Step 1: Users are now grouped into cohorts by signup month.




---

Step 2: Combine Orders with Cohort Info

SQL:

user_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        o.user_id,
        o.order_date,
        uc.cohort_month,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, uc.signup_date, o.order_date) AS months_since_signup
    FROM orders o
    JOIN user_cohort uc
      ON o.user_id = uc.user_id
)
SELECT * FROM user_orders LIMIT 5;

Example Output:

user_id	order_date	cohort_month	months_since_signup

1	2024-01-16	2024-01	0
2	2024-02-20	2024-01	1
3	2024-02-03	2024-02	0
4	2024-03-01	2024-02	1
5	2024-03-15	2024-03	0


> ✅ Step 2: Each order now shows how many months since signup.




---

Step 3: Count Active Users Per Cohort per Month

SQL:

cohort_activity AS (
    SELECT
        cohort_month,
        months_since_signup,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
    FROM user_orders
    GROUP BY cohort_month, months_since_signup
)
SELECT * FROM cohort_activity;

Example Output:

cohort_month	months_since_signup	active_users

2024-01	0	10
2024-01	1	8
2024-01	2	6
2024-02	0	12
2024-02	1	9


> ✅ Step 3: You now know active users per month for each cohort.




---

Step 4: Calculate Cohort Size

SQL:

cohort_size AS (
    SELECT
        cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users
    FROM user_cohort
    GROUP BY cohort_month
)
SELECT * FROM cohort_size;

Example Output:

cohort_month	total_users

2024-01	10
2024-02	12
2024-03	7


> ✅ Step 4: Now we know how big each cohort is.




---

Step 5: Calculate Retention Rate

SQL:

SELECT
    ca.cohort_month,
    ca.months_since_signup,
    ca.active_users,
    cs.total_users,
    ROUND((ca.active_users / cs.total_users) * 100, 2) AS retention_rate_percentage
FROM cohort_activity ca
JOIN cohort_size cs
  ON ca.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
ORDER BY ca.cohort_month, ca.months_since_signup;

Example Output:

cohort_month	months_since_signup	active_users	total_users	retention_rate_percentage

2024-01	0	10	10	100.00
2024-01	1	8	10	80.00
2024-01	2	6	10	60.00
2024-02	0	12	12	100.00
2024-02	1	9	12	75.00


> ✅ Step 5: Retention rates calculated per cohort per month. Now the marketing team can take action.

💬 Interactive Angle for LinkedIn

Ask your audience:

> “If you were the marketing manager, what strategies would you try to improve retention in Month 1? Comment below 👇”



Or even:

> “Try this SQL challenge yourself: can you pivot this result to make a retention chart for visualization?”

✅ Post Style Tips:

Break each step into LinkedIn carousel slides (or Canva visual slides)

Include animated arrows showing data flow from signup → order → retention table

Add circles/icons to highlight active users flowing into cohorts
