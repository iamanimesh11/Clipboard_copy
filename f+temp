1. Customer Complaint Initiation

Current Approach:

Multiple Channels: Samsung offers customers several ways to initiate complaints, such as through phone support, their website, mobile app, and social media channels.

AI-Powered Chatbots: Samsung uses AI-powered chatbots to help customers with common issues. The chatbot can troubleshoot simple problems, provide solutions, and guide customers to book technician visits if needed.


2. Efficient Service Request Logging and Management

Samsung Members App: This app allows customers to log complaints, track service requests, and schedule technician visits directly. It also provides troubleshooting guides and FAQs.

CRM System Integration: Samsung integrates complaints into a centralized CRM system, allowing for better tracking of customer issues and service requests. This system provides real-time data, ensuring no service request is lost or delayed.

Ticketing System: Once a complaint is lodged, an automated ticket is generated, and customers receive a tracking number. This ensures transparency in the resolution process.


3. Technician Assignment and Visit Scheduling

Current Approach:

Smart Scheduling: Samsung uses an automated system to assign technicians based on their expertise, location, and availability. This helps reduce delays and ensures the right technician is sent for the service.

Technician Mobile App: Technicians are equipped with mobile apps that provide details about the customer, the issue, and the necessary parts needed. The app also allows technicians to update the service status in real-time.

Live Chat and Video Calls: Customers can also use Samsung’s customer support services to engage in live chats or video calls with technicians, allowing for real-time troubleshooting and issue resolution.

Augmented Reality (AR) Support: Samsung has started implementing AR tools to guide technicians in performing repairs more effectively, even remotely.


5. Service Resolution and Feedback Collection

Current Approach:

Automated Feedback Requests: After a service visit, Samsung sends automated surveys to customers through SMS, email, or the Samsung Members App to collect feedback on the service experience.

Sentiment Analysis: Customer feedback is analyzed using sentiment analysis to identify any issues with the service experience. This allows Samsung to quickly address recurring problems.

Post-Service Follow-up: Samsung has a structured follow-up process where they check in with customers after repairs to ensure the issue has been fully resolved and the customer is satisfied.


6. Use of IoT and Predictive Maintenance

Current Approach:

IoT-Enabled Appliances: Samsung has integrated IoT technology into several of its appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, to send performance data to their service team. This helps identify issues before they occur.

Predictive Analytics: Samsung uses predictive maintenance models to anticipate when appliances might fail, based on the data collected from IoT-enabled devices. This helps in scheduling proactive repairs or servicing, reducing the number of unexpected breakdowns.


7. Efficient Spare Parts Management

Current Approach:

Real-Time Inventory Tracking: Samsung integrates its service network with real-time inventory systems to ensure that spare parts are available when technicians need them. This minimizes delays caused by unavailable parts.

Supply Chain Automation: Samsung uses advanced supply chain management systems to automate the ordering and delivery of parts, reducing wait times for customers.


8. Data Analytics for Continuous Improvement

Current Approach:

Customer Analytics: Samsung collects and analyzes service-related data, including customer feedback, technician performance, and complaint resolution times. This data is used to continuously improve service quality.

Root Cause Analysis: If a product issue becomes a recurring complaint, Samsung uses root cause analysis to identify and address the underlying problem, whether it’s related to design or manufacturing.


9. Omnichannel Customer Support
