If you make changes to app.py and want to update your Docker image on Docker Hub, you will need to rebuild the image, tag it with a new version (or the same tag if you prefer), and push it again. Here's how you can do it:


---

Steps to Update and Push Changes

1. Make Changes to app.py

Edit your app.py file:

nano app.py

For example, update the content to:

print("Hello again from the updated Docker image!")

Save and exit (CTRL + X, Y, Enter).



---

2. Rebuild the Docker Image

Rebuild the Docker image to include the changes in app.py:

docker build -t <username>/<repository>:<new-tag> .

Example:

docker build -t animesh/my-python-app:v2 .




---

3. Push the Updated Image to Docker Hub

Push the newly tagged image to Docker Hub:

docker push <username>/<repository>:<new-tag>

Example:

docker push animesh/my-python-app:v2




---

4. (Optional) Update the latest Tag

If you want this version to be the default (e.g., with the latest tag):

Tag the image as latest:

docker tag animesh/my-python-app:v2 animesh/my-python-app:latest

Push the latest tag:

docker push animesh/my-python-app:latest



---

5. Verify the Update

Go to your Docker Hub account and verify that the new version (e.g., v2) is listed in the repository.

You can pull the updated image on any system to confirm the changes:

docker pull animesh/my-python-app:v2

Example Workflow for Updates

# Step 1: Edit app.py
nano app.py

# Step 2: Rebuild the image
docker build -t animesh/my-python-app:v2 .

# Step 3: Push the updated image
docker push animesh/my-python-app:v2

# Step 4: Tag as latest (optional)
docker tag animesh/my-python-app:v2 animesh/my-python-app:latest
docker push animesh/my-python-app:latest
