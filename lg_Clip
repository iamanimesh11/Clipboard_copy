If edge computing is not possible, the data from appliances would need to be transmitted directly to a central storage system (e.g., cloud servers) for processing. Hereâ€™s how data storage is handled in such scenarios:


---

1. Direct Transmission to the Cloud

Without edge computing, raw sensor data is transmitted in real time or in periodic batches from the appliances to the cloud servers. This involves:

Continuous Streaming: For real-time monitoring (e.g., live temperature updates).

Periodic Uploads: Data is stored temporarily in the appliance's internal memory and uploaded periodically to reduce network load.


Example: A smart refrigerator sends raw temperature data every minute to a cloud server.


---

2. Centralized Storage Architecture

Once the data reaches the cloud, it is stored in a scalable and organized manner:

a. Data Lakes

Used to store large volumes of raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data from appliances.

Example: Storing raw sensor logs, error reports, and event triggers without immediate processing.

Technologies: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Data Lake.


b. Relational Databases

Structured data from appliances (e.g., device ID, timestamp, temperature reading) is stored in relational databases.

Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or cloud databases like Amazon RDS.


c. Time-Series Databases

Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, such as sensor readings.

Example: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.


d. Distributed File Systems

For handling large-scale data across multiple servers.

Example: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).



---

3. Data Management

To handle the vast amount of data from millions of appliances, the following techniques are used:

a. Partitioning

Data is split into smaller chunks based on criteria like appliance type, region, or time.

Example: All refrigerators in North America send data to specific storage clusters.


b. Compression

Raw data is compressed to reduce storage space and transmission costs.

Example: Temperature logs are stored as compressed binary files.


c. Indexing

Enables faster queries on large datasets.

Example: Indexes on timestamps allow quick retrieval of temperature data for a specific day.

4. Scalability

Horizontal Scaling

Additional servers are added to distribute the storage load as data grows.

Example: New cloud servers are provisioned automatically when a threshold is reached.


Cloud Storage Services

Leverage platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to ensure scalability.

Features:

Elastic Storage: Automatically adjusts storage capacity.

Data Redundancy: Replicates data across multiple servers to prevent loss.




---

5. Data Processing and Cleaning

Before the data is analyzed, it is cleaned and processed in the cloud:

Deduplication: Removes redundant entries (e.g., duplicate sensor readings).

Error Correction: Filters out erroneous data caused by sensor malfunctions.

Aggregation: Summarizes raw data into meaningful metrics (e.g., hourly averages).



---

6. Privacy and Security

Since edge computing is unavailable, securing direct data storage becomes critical:

Data Encryption:

Encrypt data during transmission (e.g., TLS).

Encrypt stored data (e.g., AES-256).


Access Control: Restrict access to sensitive data based on roles.

Anonymization: Remove or mask personally identifiable information (PII).

Example

If LG collects sensor data from 1 million refrigerators without edge computing:

1. Each appliance sends 10 MB/day of raw data.


2. Total daily data = 1 million x 10 MB = 10 TB/day.


3. Data is stored in a cloud-based data lake, partitioned by region and device type.


4. AWS or Azure services scale automatically to accommodate growing data volumes.

Challenges

1. High Bandwidth Costs: Direct raw data transmission can significantly increase network costs.


2. Latency: Real-time actions may face delays due to cloud processing.


3. Scalability: Managing storage and compute resources for large datasets can be complex.



By optimizing storage architecture and leveraging modern cloud solutions, it is possible to handle raw data without edge computing, though it demands more resources.
