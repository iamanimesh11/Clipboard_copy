If edge computing is not possible, the data from appliances would need to be transmitted directly to a central storage system (e.g., cloud servers) for processing. Here’s how data storage is handled in such scenarios:


---

1. Direct Transmission to the Cloud

Without edge computing, raw sensor data is transmitted in real time or in periodic batches from the appliances to the cloud servers. This involves:

Continuous Streaming: For real-time monitoring (e.g., live temperature updates).

Periodic Uploads: Data is stored temporarily in the appliance's internal memory and uploaded periodically to reduce network load.


Example: A smart refrigerator sends raw temperature data every minute to a cloud server.


---

2. Centralized Storage Architecture

Once the data reaches the cloud, it is stored in a scalable and organized manner:

a. Data Lakes

Used to store large volumes of raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data from appliances.

Example: Storing raw sensor logs, error reports, and event triggers without immediate processing.

Technologies: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Data Lake.


b. Relational Databases

Structured data from appliances (e.g., device ID, timestamp, temperature reading) is stored in relational databases.

Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or cloud databases like Amazon RDS.


c. Time-Series Databases

Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, such as sensor readings.

Example: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.


d. Distributed File Systems

For handling large-scale data across multiple servers.

Example: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).



---

3. Data Management

To handle the vast amount of data from millions of appliances, the following techniques are used:

a. Partitioning

Data is split into smaller chunks based on criteria like appliance type, region, or time.

Example: All refrigerators in North America send data to specific storage clusters.


b. Compression

Raw data is compressed to reduce storage space and transmission costs.

Example: Temperature logs are stored as compressed binary files.


c. Indexing

Enables faster queries on large datasets.

Example: Indexes on timestamps allow quick retrieval of temperature data for a specific day.



---

4. Scalability

Horizontal Scaling

Additional servers are added to distribute the storage load as data grows.

Example: New cloud servers are provisioned automatically when a threshold is reached.


Cloud Storage Services

Leverage platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to ensure scalability.

Features:

Elastic Storage: Automatically adjusts storage capacity.

Data Redundancy: Replicates data across multiple servers to prevent loss.




---

5. Data Processing and Cleaning

Before the data is analyzed, it is cleaned and processed in the cloud:

Deduplication: Removes redundant entries (e.g., duplicate sensor readings).

Error Correction: Filters out erroneous data caused by sensor malfunctions.

Aggregation: Summarizes raw data into meaningful metrics (e.g., hourly averages).



---

6. Privacy and Security

Since edge computing is unavailable, securing direct data storage becomes critical:

Data Encryption:

Encrypt data during transmission (e.g., TLS).

Encrypt stored data (e.g., AES-256).


Access Control: Restrict access to sensitive data based on roles.

Anonymization: Remove or mask personally identifiable information (PII).



---

Example

If LG collects sensor data from 1 million refrigerators without edge computing:

1. Each appliance sends 10 MB/day of raw data.


2. Total daily data = 1 million x 10 MB = 10 TB/day.


3. Data is stored in a cloud-based data lake, partitioned by region and device type.


4. AWS or Azure services scale automatically to accommodate growing data volumes.




---

Challenges

1. High Bandwidth Costs: Direct raw data transmission can significantly increase network costs.


2. Latency: Real-time actions may face delays due to cloud processing.


3. Scalability: Managing storage and compute resources for large datasets can be complex.



By optimizing storage architecture and leveraging modern cloud solutions, it is possible to handle raw data without edge computing, though it demands more resources.





Let me break it down in a simpler, more practical way. Suppose we have 10 washing machines in a specific area, and each one generates logs every day. Here's how the data is typically handled step by step, and I'll focus on keeping it practical without too many technical buzzwords.


---

Step 1: Data Collection from Washing Machines

Each washing machine generates logs that contain information like:

Cycle data: Start/stop times, mode used (e.g., quick wash, heavy wash).

Error logs: Any issues detected (e.g., water level too low, drum imbalance).

Usage stats: Number of cycles run per day, energy consumed.


These logs are stored temporarily in the washing machine's memory.


---

Step 2: Sending Data to the Cloud

Since there’s no edge computing in this scenario:

1. Each washing machine sends its logs directly to a central cloud server.

Example: Washing machine logs are uploaded every 15 minutes or at the end of every cycle.



2. The logs are transmitted via Wi-Fi or a cellular network.



Example:

Each washing machine generates 5 MB of logs per day.

10 washing machines x 5 MB = 50 MB/day for the entire area.



---

Step 3: Initial Storage in the Cloud

Once the logs are received in the cloud, they are stored in a data lake.

What is a Data Lake?

It's a big storage space where all raw data is dumped without processing.

Think of it as a giant folder that holds everything (e.g., logs from all washing machines).



Why Use a Data Lake?

Storing raw data first ensures nothing is lost.

Raw data can be processed later into meaningful insights.



---

Step 4: Organizing Data for Analysis

After storing raw logs, the next step is organizing the data for analysis:

Logs are processed to remove duplicates, clean errors, and extract useful information.

Data is grouped by:

Device ID: Each washing machine has a unique identifier.

Date/Time: Organize logs by when they were generated.

Location: Separate logs by area or region.



The cleaned and structured data can then be stored in:

Data Warehouses: For fast querying and reporting.

Time-Series Databases: For analyzing trends over time (e.g., usage patterns).



---

Step 5: Analytics and Insights

Once the data is structured, it can be used for:

1. Real-Time Monitoring:

Detect malfunctions as they happen.

Notify users if maintenance is needed.



2. Usage Trends:

Analyze how often machines are used in the area.

Predict peak usage times.



3. Product Improvements:

Identify common issues (e.g., recurring drum imbalance).

Improve future washing machine models based on real-world data.

How AWS Helps Here

AWS provides tools to manage each step:

1. Data Storage:

AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is used as the data lake to store raw logs.



2. Data Processing:

AWS Lambda can process and clean logs as they arrive.



3. Data Analysis:

AWS Redshift (data warehouse) organizes the cleaned data for reporting.

Amazon QuickSight provides dashboards to visualize insights (e.g., average cycles per day in the area).





---

Simplified Example in Practice

Here’s how this works in practice for your 10 washing machines:

1. Each machine sends its logs (e.g., 5 MB/day) to a central cloud server (e.g., AWS S3).


2. Logs are stored as raw data in folders named by date and device ID.

Folder example: area_123/2025-01-20/device_001_logs.json



3. At the end of the day, AWS processes the logs to extract useful information:

Total cycles per machine.

Common errors reported.



4. Cleaned data is stored in AWS Redshift for analysis.


5. Reports are generated for LG to identify patterns:

"5 out of 10 machines reported water level issues."

"Peak usage time is 6 PM to 9 PM."

Key Takeaway

Raw data → Data Lake (store everything)

Organized data → Data Warehouse (for analysis and reports)


This approach ensures:

No data is lost (thanks to the data lake).

Fast analysis for business insights (using the data warehouse).
