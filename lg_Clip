If the Generative AI API or any other Google Cloud API requires a service account, you can create one and use it for authentication. Here's how:


---

Step 1: Create a Service Account

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.


2. Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.


3. Click Create Service Account.


4. Fill in the following details:

Service account name: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., genai-service-account).

Service account ID: This will be auto-generated.

Description: (Optional) Add a description.



5. Click Create and Continue.

Step 2: Assign Roles

1. In the "Grant this service account access to project" section:

Add the role: Vertex AI User (or any role needed for the Generative AI API).

Additional roles may be needed depending on your use case.



2. Click Continue and then Done.

Step 3: Generate a Service Account Key

1. In the Service Accounts page, find the account you created.


2. Click the Actions Menu (â‹®) > Manage Keys.


3. Click Add Key > Create New Key.


4. Choose JSON as the key type and click Create.

A JSON file containing the service account key will be downloaded automatically. Keep this file secure.





---

Step 4: Use the Service Account Key in Your Code

To authenticate your application using the service account key:

1. Install the Google Cloud library if you haven't already:

pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client


2. Set the environment variable to point to the downloaded JSON key file:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"


3. Use the service account to access the Generative AI API in your script:

from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import google.generativeai as genai

# Authenticate with the service account
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    "/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"
)

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", credentials=credentials)

model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="gemini-1.5-flash")
response = model.generate_content("Summarize this text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
print(response.text)




---

Step 5: Test the Service Account

Run your script to ensure it connects successfully to the API.

If you encounter permission issues, double-check the roles assigned to the service account.
