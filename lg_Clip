Here’s a summarized version of how **LG’s current after-sales service process** typically operates based on general observations of their approach in many regions:  

---

### **1. Customer Complaint Initiation**  
- **Channels**: Customers lodge complaints through:  
  - LG customer care helplines.  
  - Emails or contact forms on the LG website.  
  - LG mobile apps (where available).  
  - Walk-ins at service centers.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Limited availability of self-service options.  
  - Delays in connecting with customer care or in response times.  

---

### **2. Service Request Logging**  
- **Process**:  
  - Customer support agents log complaints into a system.  
  - A ticket is created, and a unique complaint ID is shared with the customer.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - The ticketing process is manual in some regions, leading to inefficiencies.  
  - Customers often find it hard to track the status of their complaints.  

---

### **3. Technician Assignment and Visit Scheduling**  
- **Process**:  
  - Complaints are manually assigned to technicians based on the customer’s location and the type of appliance.  
  - Technicians contact the customer to schedule a visit.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Lack of automated scheduling systems leads to delays.  
  - Customers don’t have visibility into technician availability or ETA.  

---

### **4. Technician Visit**  
- **Process**:  
  - The technician diagnoses the appliance issue during the visit.  
  - If spare parts are required, the repair is delayed until the parts are ordered and delivered.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - **Unavailability of Spare Parts**: Parts are not always readily available, causing extended delays.  
  - **Inaccurate Diagnosis**: Technicians sometimes visit without proper knowledge of the issue, requiring multiple visits.  
  - **Communication Gaps**: Customers are not updated about delays or next steps proactively.  

---

### **5. Resolution and Feedback Collection**  
- **Process**:  
  - After completing the repair, the service request is marked as resolved.  
  - Customers may be asked to provide feedback through calls or surveys.  

- **Challenges**:  
  - Feedback collection is inconsistent and often poorly implemented.  
  - Little to no follow-up on unresolved issues or negative feedback.  

---

### **6. Overall Gaps in Current LG Service**  

#### **1. Lack of Advanced Technology Integration**  
- No IoT or remote diagnostic tools for pre-emptive issue identification.  
- Minimal use of AI or automation for complaint logging, technician allocation, or tracking.  

#### **2. Spare Parts Management**  
- Weak integration between service teams and supply chains leads to delays in sourcing parts.  

#### **3. Limited Real-Time Tracking**  
- Customers cannot track the technician’s location or get real-time updates on complaint resolution progress.  

#### **4. Poor Feedback Utilization**  
- Customer feedback is often not used effectively for service improvements.  

#### **5. Proactive Maintenance Missing**  
- No predictive maintenance or analytics-driven issue identification, resulting in reactive rather than proactive support.

### **Key Comparison: LG vs. Samsung After-Sales Service**  

| **Aspect**                     | **LG**                                       | **Samsung**                                   |  
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| **Self-Service Options**       | Limited, primarily via calls or websites.   | Robust self-service app (Samsung Members).   |  
| **Complaint Logging**          | Manual or semi-automated in some cases.     | Fully automated ticketing systems.           |  
| **Technician Assignment**      | Manual allocation; delays common.           | Automated smart scheduling; GPS tracking.    |  
| **Remote Diagnostics**         | Rare or unavailable.                        | IoT-enabled appliances + AR/remote tools.    |  
| **Spare Parts Availability**   | Frequent delays due to poor inventory linkage. | Efficient real-time inventory tracking.      |  
| **Customer Tracking**          | Basic updates via calls/SMS.                | Real-time tracking and notifications.        |  
| **Predictive Maintenance**     | Not implemented.                            | IoT-based proactive maintenance.             |  
| **Feedback Collection**        | Inconsistent and poorly utilized.           | Automated, with sentiment analysis.          |
