💯 You're absolutely right to close the loop. Let’s give you clean, production-grade solutions for the first 4 questions, which you already attempted yourself — I’ll write them out clearly below with explanations so you can compare and reinforce your mastery. 🔁

  SELECT 
    user_id,

✅ 1. What is the longest login streak per user?

> “For each user, what’s the maximum number of consecutive login days they ever had?”

  FROM streaks
  GROUP BY user_id, streak_base
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM streak_lengths
GROUP BY user_id;

✅ 2. On which date did the 7-day streak start?

> “Find the start date of the user’s first 7-day login streak.”



WITH base AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    login_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) AS rn
  FROM user_logins
),

✅ 4. What’s the average length of each user’s streak?

> “For each user, calculate their average streak length (across all streaks, long or short).”



WITH base AS (

✅ Summary of the First 4:

Query #	What it does	Key Clause

1	Longest streak per user	MAX(COUNT(*))
2	Start date of 7-day streak	MIN(login_date) w/ HAVING COUNT(*) >= 7
3	Count of 7-day streaks per user	GROUP BY user_id, streak_base + HAVING
4	Average streak length	AVG(COUNT(*)) per user

📘 Reminder: Base Table

user_logins(user_id, login_date)

We'll use a shared base CTE to assign row numbers and compute streak anchors:

WITH base AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    login_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) AS rn
  FROM user_logins
),
streaks AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    login_date,
    rn,
    login_date - INTERVAL rn DAY AS streak_base
  FROM base
)

From here, we'll build all remaining queries.

✅ 5. Gap Between Two Longest Streaks

WITH longest_streaks AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    streak_base,
    COUNT(*) AS streak_length,
    MIN(login_date) AS start_date,
    MAX(login_date) AS end_date
  FROM streaks
  GROUP BY user_id, streak_base
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY streak_length DESC) AS rnk
  FROM longest_streaks
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN end_date END) AS longest_end,
  MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN start_date END) AS second_start,
  DATEDIFF(
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN start_date END),
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN end_date END)
  ) AS gap_days
FROM ranked
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

✅ 6. Day 1, Day 3, Day 7 Retention (Cohort Analysis)

Assume there's a signups table:

signups(user_id, signup_date)

SELECT 
  s.signup_date,
  ROUND(SUM(u.login_day = 1) / COUNT(*), 2) AS day1_retention,
  ROUND(SUM(u.login_day = 3) / COUNT(*), 2) AS day3_retention,
  ROUND(SUM(u.login_day = 7) / COUNT(*), 2) AS day7_retention
FROM signups s
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    DATEDIFF(login_date, signup_date) AS login_day
  FROM user_logins l
  JOIN signups s ON l.user_id = s.user_id
) u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY s.signup_date;


---

✅ 7. Segment Users by Behavior Tier

WITH user_streaks AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) AS streak_length
  FROM streaks
  GROUP BY user_id, streak_base
),
max_streaks AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    MAX(streak_length) AS max_streak
  FROM user_streaks
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  max_streak,
  CASE 
    WHEN max_streak >= 7 THEN 'Addicted'
    WHEN max_streak >= 3 THEN 'Engaged'
    ELSE 'Casual'
  END AS user_tier
FROM max_streaks;


---

✅ 8. Calendar Heatmap-Style Output

Let’s suppose you're asked to show login status for a range of dates — example: June 1 to June 7.

SELECT 
  user_id,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-01') AS d1,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-02') AS d2,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-03') AS d3,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-04') AS d4,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-05') AS d5,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-06') AS d6,
  MAX(login_date = '2024-06-07') AS d7
FROM user_logins
GROUP BY user_id;

You can automate this with dynamic SQL in real BI dashboards.

✅ 9. Drop-off After a Streak

> Find users who had a 7-day streak and then did not log in for next 3 days



WITH user_streaks AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    streak_base,
    COUNT(*) AS streak_len,
    MAX(login_date) AS streak_end
  FROM streaks
  GROUP BY user_id, streak_base
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 7
),
next_logins AS (
  SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    s.streak_end,
    MIN(l.login_date) AS next_login
  FROM user_streaks s
  LEFT JOIN user_logins l 
    ON s.user_id = l.user_id AND l.login_date > s.streak_end
  GROUP BY u.user_id, s.streak_end
)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  streak_end,
  next_login,
  DATEDIFF(next_login, streak_end) AS gap_days
FROM next_logins
WHERE next_login IS NULL OR DATEDIFF(next_login, streak_end) > 3;
