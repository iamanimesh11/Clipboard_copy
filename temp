Subject: Support Required for SMTP Activity Issue in Converted Project

Dear Young A. Kim,

I hope this message finds you well.

As per your suggestion, I have started the conversion of one of our ongoing projects titled "India_LGEIL_Shipment_Tracking" from the legacy Windows platform to the modern Windows environment.

During the process, I’ve encountered significant delays due to time-consuming error validation and analysis. Resolving some of the critical issues, especially those related to core functionalities, will require additional time.

One key issue is with the SMTP activity, which is a vital component of the project. After the recent update, the SMTP activity now requires a connection to be configured, whereas earlier it worked by directly passing parameters such as Server, Port, etc.

While attempting to add the required connection, I encountered the following error:
"Requested page not found" at the URL:
https://orch.lge.com/restricted-access?tid=1&fid=154
It seems access to this page might be restricted.

As SMTP is used in nearly all of our projects, I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
