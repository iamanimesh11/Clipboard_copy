Dear Young a kim,





I have made the conversion of one of developing project titled as : "India_LGEIL_Shipment_Tracking" from windows legacy to windows as suggested by you and so currently project taking much  time in error validation and analyzing.

It will take time in fixing critical errors for now.



One of error I'm getting is in SMTP Activity which is highly necessary part of project.

SMTP activity has been updated now and asking for connection in new update while previously it was working fine with passing Parameter : Server,Port and so on.

While adding connection getting error a requested page not found on "https://orch.lge.com/restricted-access?tid=1&fid=154" may be restricted to access the page.



Kindly support on this issue as we are using smtp in almost all projects.
