🚀 Funnel Drop-off Analysis in EdTech: Turning Data into Actionable Insights

🎯 Task Overview
In our ed-tech platform, we want users to successfully complete a course by following this ideal funnel:
1️⃣ start_course → 2️⃣ complete_video → 3️⃣ quiz_start → 4️⃣ quiz_submit

But not everyone completes the journey. Our goal? Identify where learners drop off and why.

🔍 What we did:
For every user who didn’t complete the full funnel, we returned:

✅ user_id

🛑 The last step they completed

🔜 The next step they missed — their drop-off point


📊 Why this matters:
By pinpointing exactly where engagement drops, we can:

Personalize nudges or interventions

Optimize content and user flow

Improve completion rates & learner outcomes


Data isn't just numbers — it's a story. And every drop-off tells us something valuable.
