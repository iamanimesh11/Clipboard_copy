Perfect! Here’s the correct way to create a partitioned and clustered table directly from the GA session dataset, without needing a temp table. I made sure the column names and partitioning work properly.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Practice.ga_Sessions_partitioned
PARTITION BY visit_date                 -- partition by the correct column
CLUSTER BY fullVisitorId, trafficsource
AS
SELECT 
    fullVisitorId,
    visitStartTime,
    totals.pageviews AS pv,
    hits.page.pagePath AS pagePath,
    trafficSource.source AS trafficsource,
    DATE(TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(visitStartTime)) AS visit_date
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`,
    UNNEST(hits) AS hits
WHERE 
    _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170801' AND '20170831';

✅ Notes:

1. visit_date is all lowercase, because that’s what we define in the SELECT. Partitioning column must match exactly.


2. Now you can query:



SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Practice.ga_Sessions_partitioned;
SELECT * FROM Practice.ga_Sessions_partitioned
WHERE visit_date = '2017-08-01'
LIMIT 10;

The table will be properly partitioned by visit_date.

Clustered by fullVisitorId and trafficsource.

If you want, I can also show a quick trick to check partitioned table storage and query cost so you can see how BigQuery reads partitions instead of scanning everything.

Do you want me to show that next?
