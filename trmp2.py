🚀 Project Drop!
Long break but After 2–3 months of learning, building, debugging, and Lots of coffee☕… I’m here to share:

“Real-Time ETL Roads Traffic & Weather Monitoring ” — a complete Data Engineering powerhouse Project !

🛣️🌦️ What’s it all about?
This system captures live road, traffic, and weather data using APIs, processes it through Apache Airflow & Kafka, stores it in PostgreSQL, and monitors logs everything with Grafana Loki — all running seamlessly in Docker containers!

✨ Just docker compose up -d --build and you're good to go!🔥

⚙️ Built With:

🐍 Python as the core language
📡 TomTom, Overpass & Weather APIs
⏰ Apache Airflow for ETL orchestration
🔄 Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
🧱 PostgreSQL for structured storage
📊 Grafana Loki + Promtail for centralized logging
🧪 Custom Streamlit UI for guiding ETL helpers
🔐 API Keys and secrets stored securely with Firebase
🔔 Discord Webhooks for error & process alerts

📦 Everything is production-inspired:
Retries, fallbacks, modular configs, Docker volumes, and clean logging built for scale!
