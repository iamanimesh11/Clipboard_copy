Create a clean, organized DSA notes structure in Notion. 

### Main Goal:
I want a master page titled **DSA Notes** with a sub-page for **Arrays**. Inside Arrays, create:
1. A page called **Arrays – Patterns** with a table of common array patterns.
2. Each pattern should automatically have its own sub-page.
3. Inside each pattern page, generate a problems table.
4. Include a reusable problem-template section.

---

### 1. Arrays – Patterns Page
Create a table named **Array Patterns** with these columns:
- Pattern (Title)
- Description (Text)
- Difficulty Range (Text)
- Link (Page)

Add rows for these patterns:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Prefix Sum
- Hashing / Frequency Map
- Kadane / DP on Arrays
- Binary Search on Answer

Each row should link to a sub-page named:
**Pattern – <Pattern Name>**

### 2. Inside Each Pattern Page
Generate:

#### Overview Section
Short summary of:
- When to use the pattern
- Why it works
- Common use cases

#### Problems Table
Make a table with columns:
- Problem (Title)
- Category
- Approach Summary
- Time
- Space
- Status
- Link

Add 2–3 example problems for each pattern.

#### Problem Template
Add this template for adding new problems:

### Problem Name  
**Link:**  
**Category:**  

#### Intuition  
(Explain the core idea)

#### Approach  
(Write the steps)

#### Code  
(Empty code block)

#### Complexity  
- Time:  
- Space:

### 3. Format Everything Nicely
Use proper headings, tables, and dividers.
