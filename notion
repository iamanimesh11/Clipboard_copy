Got it.
Here are all the essential array problem patterns that cover almost every array-based DSA problem on LeetCode and interviews.

This is the list you will put into your Patterns Table inside the Array topic.

I’ll organize them cleanly + explain what each pattern covers.

⭐ MASTER LIST: Array Problem Patterns (Complete)

These 15 patterns cover 95% of array problems you will ever see.


---

1️⃣ Two-Pointers

Used for:

sorted arrays

pair sum problems

removing duplicates

moving elements


Examples:

Two Sum II

Remove Duplicates

Container With Most Water

3Sum



---

2️⃣ Sliding Window (Fixed Window)

Used when window size is fixed (k).

Examples:

Max Sum Subarray of Size K

First Negative in Every Window



---

3️⃣ Sliding Window (Variable Window)

Used when window expands & shrinks based on condition.

Examples:

Longest Substring Without Repeating

Minimum Window Subarray



---

4️⃣ Prefix Sum

Used for subarray sum problems.

Examples:

Subarray Sum Equals K

Range Sum Query

Counting subarrays with given sum



---

5️⃣ Kadane’s Algorithm

Used for maximum subarray problems.

Examples:

Maximum Subarray (Kadane)

Max Circular Subarray



---

6️⃣ Binary Search on Array

Used when the array is sorted or rotated.

Examples:

Binary Search

Search in Rotated Sorted Array

First/Last Occurrence



---

7️⃣ Sorting + Two-Pointers

Used when sorting helps simplify logic.

Examples:

3Sum

4Sum

Merge Intervals (after sorting intervals)



---

8️⃣ Frequency Map / Hashing

Used for counting elements efficiently.

Examples:

Majority Element

Two Sum (Hashmap version)



---

9️⃣ Difference Array / Range Update

Used when multiple range updates needed.

Examples:

Corp Flight Bookings

Range Addition



---

🔟 Greedy Array Problems

Used when choosing best local option leads to global solution.

Examples:

Jump Game

Minimum Platforms

Gas Station



---

1️⃣1️⃣ Intervals (Common in arrays)

Used when working with start/end pairs.

Examples:

Merge Intervals

Insert Interval

Meeting Rooms



---

1️⃣2️⃣ Monotonic Stack (Array-specific)

Used to find:

next greater element

previous greater

next smaller


Examples:

Next Greater Element

Daily Temperatures

Largest Rectangle in Histogram



---

1️⃣3️⃣ Matrix as Array-of-Arrays

All 2D array problems.

Examples:

Spiral Matrix

Rotate Matrix

Transpose



---

1️⃣4️⃣ Product-Based Patterns

Used when multiplication required instead of sum.

Examples:

Product of Array Except Self

Subarray Product Less Than K



---

1️⃣5️⃣ Bucket / Counting / Pigeonhole

Used when values fall in a limited range.

Examples:

Sort Colors

Kth Largest Element (counting)



---

🎯 THIS IS THE COMPLETE PATTERN SET FOR ARRAY PROBLEMS.

If you add these patterns to your Notion Array page, you will cover almost every LC array problem.

⭐ HOW THIS GOES INTO YOUR NOTION

Inside topic ARRAY, your Patterns Table will be:

Pattern Name	Description

Two Pointers	left & right pointers
Sliding Window – Fixed	window size K
Sliding Window – Variable	expand/shrink
Prefix Sum	cumulative array
Kadane’s	max subarray
Binary Search on Array	sorted/rotated arrays
Sorting + Two Pointers	3Sum, 4Sum
Hashing / Frequency Map	counts & frequency
Difference Array	range updates
Greedy	jump game
Intervals	merge, overlap
Monotonic Stack	next greater
Matrix Patterns	2D array logic
Product Patterns	multiplication-based
Bucket / Counting	limited-range values


Each pattern opens a page → inside that page, you add problems table for that pattern.
