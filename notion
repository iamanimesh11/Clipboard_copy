🎁 Want me to generate a fully formatted Notion export file?

I can generate:

✅ A prebuilt Notion template file (.zip)
✅ All concepts already added
✅ All pages with the template attached
✅ Category dashboards
✅ A spaced-repetition system

Just tell me:

Do you want the entire DSA template exported as a Notion file you can import directly?
