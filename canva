Dear Ma'am,

I would like to inquire about the job role. As the DPDP Act rules have been finalized by MIETY, I am wondering if the recruitment process will proceed and what the expected timeline for this might be.

Any updates regarding this would be greatly appreciated, as it would allow me to prepare accordingly.

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,
Animesh Singh
